cal usage of create_engine() is once per particular database URL, 
held globally for the lifetime of a single application process. 
A single Engine manages many individual DBAPI connections on behalf 
of the process and is intended to be called upon in a concurrent fashion. 
The Engine is not synonymous to the DBAPI connect function, 
which represents just one connection resource - the Engine is most efficient when created 
just once at the module level of an application, not per-object or per-function call.
