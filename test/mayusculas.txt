CAL USAGE OF CREATE_ENGINE() IS ONCE PER PARTICULAR DATABASE URL, 
HELD GLOBALLY FOR THE LIFETIME OF A SINGLE APPLICATION PROCESS. 
A SINGLE ENGINE MANAGES MANY INDIVIDUAL DBAPI CONNECTIONS ON BEHALF 
OF THE PROCESS AND IS INTENDED TO BE CALLED UPON IN A CONCURRENT FASHION. 
THE ENGINE IS NOT SYNONYMOUS TO THE DBAPI CONNECT FUNCTION, 
WHICH REPRESENTS JUST ONE CONNECTION RESOURCE - THE ENGINE IS MOST EFFICIENT WHEN CREATED 
JUST ONCE AT THE MODULE LEVEL OF AN APPLICATION, NOT PER-OBJECT OR PER-FUNCTION CALL.
