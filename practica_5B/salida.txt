When push.default is set to 'matching', git will push local branches
o the remote branches that already exist with the same name. Since Git 2.0, Git defaults to the more conservative 'simple'
ehavior, which only pushes the current branch to the corresponding
emote branch that 'git pull' uses to update the current branch. See 'git help config' and search for 'push.default' for further information.
the 'simple' mode was introduced in Git 1.7.11. Use the similar mode
